# Vector-Valued Neural Networks (V-Nets)

This repository contains source code for implementing vector-valued neural networks (V-nets). V-nets are designed to process arrays of vectors while naturally considering the intercorrelation between feature channels. They often have fewer parameters and undergo more robust training than traditional real-valued neural networks, which typically learn feature intercorrelations from the data.
